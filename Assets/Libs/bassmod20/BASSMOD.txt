What's the point?
=================
BASSMOD is a stripped-down "MOD only" version of the BASS audio system.
This is useful if you only need to play some MOD music in a demo/etc...
If you require a more complete audio library, then you should get the
full BASS library (website URL below).


Requirements
============
BASSMOD uses the Windows MultiMedia drivers on Win32 & PocketPC platforms,
the OSS drivers on Linux, and the Core Audio drivers on Mac OS X, so there
are no special library/driver requirements.


Using BASSMOD
=============
There is no guarantee that all BASSMOD versions will be compatible with
all previous versions, so your program should use BASSMOD_GetVersion to
check the version that is loaded. This also means that you should put
the BASSMOD module in the same directory as your program, not just
somewhere in the path, to avoid the possibility of a wrong version being
loaded.

If you are updating your software from a previous BASSMOD version, then
you should check the "History" section (below), to see which (if any)
of the functions that you are using have been affected by a change.

Win32 version
-------------
C/C++, Delphi, Visual Basic and MASM APIs are provided, to use BASSMOD
with another language you'll first have to convert the header file. Or
you could load it dynamically (eg. use LoadLibrary & GetProcAddress).

To use BASSMOD with Borland C++ Builder, you'll first have to create a
Borland C++ Builder import library for it. This is done by using the
IMPLIB tool that comes with Borland C++ Builder. Simply execute this:

	IMPLIB BASSMODB.LIB BASSMOD.DLL

... and then use BASSMODB.LIB in your projects to import BASSMOD.

Linux version
-------------
A "LIB" file is not required for Linux, you can build your programs like
this, for example:

	gcc yoursource ./libbassmod.so -o yourprog
or
	gcc yoursource -lbassmod -o yourprog

In the first case, the LIBBASSMOD.SO file will need to be in the same
directory as the executable (and it can only be run from there). In the
2nd case, it will have to be somewhere in the path, eg. /usr/lib

Another option is to use the "rpath" linker option to specify exactly
where it should be loaded from at run-time, for example:

	gcc yoursource -lbassmod -Wl,-rpath,/some/path -o yourprog

Mac OSX version
---------------
A "LIB" file is also not required for OSX, you can build your programs
like this, for example:

	gcc yoursource ./libbassmod.dylib -o yourprog
or
	gcc yoursource -L. -lbassmod -o yourprog

The LIBBASSMOD.DYLIB file must be put in the same directory as the
executable (it can't just be somewhere in the path). See the example
makefile.
